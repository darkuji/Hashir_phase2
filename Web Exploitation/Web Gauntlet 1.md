# Web Gauntlet 1

## Solution
Started off by reading up on sql injections and referring to an
injection cheatsheet online then for round 1 i used username as 
admin'-- since -- starts a comment in sql and the password would be ignored
(it was stated that only wrong credentials work) for round 2 i used /* which
also comments out the later part of the input and for round 3 the same username
worked for some reason. Round 4 required concatenation and hence after looking up
how to concatenate strings in sql i entered the username as adm'||'in'/*' which 
worked for round 5 aswell because the union with admin would still include the current
username
