# SSTI1

## Solution
Started off by opening the website which "lets us announce what we want"
hinting that there could be a template in the backend and we need to inject
something which will potentially give back the flag. Searched for SSTI tools
on GitHub and put in {{config}} which gave me the configuration indicating it 
was python then i used the command {{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }} to get the name of the flag file then
simply wrote the command again with cat flag instead of ls to obtain the flag



## Flag
```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_bcf73b04}
```
