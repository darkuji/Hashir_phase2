# Cookies

## Solution
Started off by opening the inspect panel then going to cookies then entered
the name as snickerdoodle and saw that the value of the cookie named 'name'
changed from -1 to 0 and then i tried using different values like 0 5 10 
for name to see the upper limit and found that it was 28 then went down from
28 and finally got the flag at value 18



## Flag
