# Format string 0

## Solution
As the title suggests, we had to look for format specifiers in the options
given to us, for the first one it was pretty obvious as % is mod and 114d is 
a 114 digit decimal number, however for the second one it took me a while to 
understand that %s would be the best option as we are working with strings here and
selected the classic cheesesteak option
