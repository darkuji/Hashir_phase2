# I like logic

## Solution
Saw that the file was of .sal extension looked up how to analyze logic for 
.sal files and stumbled upon a software named logic 2. Opened the challenge file
and used the input channel as 3 because that was the only one which looked like it 
had some useful data. Used the default Async serial to process the logic and saw a story
as the output which had the flag hidden between it
